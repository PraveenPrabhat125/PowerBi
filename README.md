Coronavirus data analysis 



A COVID-19 dashboard in Power BI is like a computer screen that shows pictures and numbers about the virus. You can use it to see how many people have gotten sick, how many have died, and how many have recovered. You can look at the data for different places, like countries or states. The dashboard also has maps that show where the virus is spreading. You can click on different buttons to change what you see on the screen.


People like doctors, government officials, and anyone interested in COVID-19 can use the dashboard to understand how the virus is spreading and make decisions about what to do to stop it.
